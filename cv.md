Experience
---------

---
**IIS SB RAS**, Intern developer (June - July 2025)

Contributed to infrastructure and developed CI/CD pipelines for bioinformatics platform

<br>

---
**YADRO Lab NSU**, Researcher student (2024 - present)

Researched Trusted Compilation for mitigating [_"Trusting Trust"_ attacks](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf), mainly:
- Prototyped Double-Diverse Compilation based verification pipeline (Docker, [live-bootstrap](https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap) linux).
- Prototyped false-negative testing for verification pipeline via using Trusting Trust attack techniques.

Contributed to LLVM backend for "CdM-16" educational ISA:
- Led and consulted the team, contributed fixes in [summer bootcamp project](https://github.com/ylab-nsu/llvm-project-cdm-bc25).
- Led backend team and contributed in [second year student project](https://github.com/ylab-nsu/cdm16-llvm-neo/).
